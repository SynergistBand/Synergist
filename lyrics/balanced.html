<p>feel the weight<br>
  tip the scale below<br>
  proportioned powers where the light was meant to grow<br>
  cast aside<br>
  left behind<br>
  <br>
  now, we all demand achievement for our hard work<br>
  the sentiment, you'll find that is too hard to ignore<br>
  and without reward, you'll find its hard to motivate at all<br>
  but if we ain't hungry, why cannibalize the poor?<br>
  left to die<br>
  let the strong survive<br>
  yeah right<br>
  <br>
  you feel the weight<br>
  tip the scale below<br>
  proportioned powers where the light was meant to grow<br>
  now you know, with a lack of balance caused by those who would tip the boat<br>
  it takes its toll on the world that strives to stay afloat<br>
  <br>
  too far to one side<br>
  you'll find the greedy and the selfish thrive<br>
  polarized, well, you'd find outright denial of it all<br>
  but all in all, when it balances<br>
  we find the peace of mind and the life will carry on and on<br>
  <br>
  let it carry on<br>
  spent all your life in adoration<br>
  of the golden mean<br>
  with the fears below<br>
  so rock the boat<br>
  in moderation<br>
  till the counterweight gets heavy, take back control<br>
  set us back on course<br>
  <br>
  till you feel the weight<br>
  you know<br>
  proportioned power's where the light was meant to grow<br>
  now you know, with a lack of balance caused by those who would tip the boat<br>
  it takes its toll on the world that strives to stay afloat<br>
  <br>
  too far one side<br>
  you'll find the greedy and the selfish, they thrive<br>
  polarized, well, you'd find outright denial of it all<br>
  but all in all, when it balances<br>
  we find the peace of mind and the light will carry on<br>
  <br>
  beauty is truth<br>
  truth is beauty<br>
  that is all you'll know within this world<br>
  and it's all you need to know to save your soul</p>
