<p>let's get carried away, create<br>

extravagent display<br>

when seen from beyond our world<br>

well, the darkness perpherates<br>
<br>


with the power to light these skies<br>

comes the blinders on our eyes<br>

when all along these ancient sights have shined<br>

where burning fires are road signs still reaching for the eyes <br>
<br>


as the night is falling<br>

they will watch from afar<br>

see the glow from the cities<br>
be replaced by the stars<br><br>

that great beyond<br>
I keep asking myself<br>
where have they gone?<br><br>

this relation, the Drake equates<br>
the worlds beyond our skies<br>
the wisdom of ghosts denied... then lost in sands of time<br><br>

the blinding babel, built so high<br>
the fire scrapes the sky<br>
for all, below, we live without the right<br>
to see beyond the bright and feed that meaning of the night<br><br>

as the darkness, it conquers the light<br>
they will watch from afar<br>
see the glow from the cities<br>
be replaced by the stars<br><br>

the great beyond<br>
I feel humbled, myself<br>
I look above<br><br>

they saw us arise<br>
saw us arrive<br>
with God as a witness they'll see the great decline<br><br>

feeling alone<br>
to hide in the glow, below<br>
would be like denying myself the rites of old<br><br>

let's get carried away...<br>
we're only light years away... from home<br><br>

I'll see you when the darkness falls</p><span style="color:#000000; font-size:10px;">*CutcH is Craig McCutcheon</span></td></tr></table></center>
