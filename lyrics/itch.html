  <p>beyond the edge of our exteriors<br>
    the itch begins to grow<br>
    we could try to scratch ourselves<br>
    but I just can't help but feel beside myself, when I'm alone</p>
  <p>eyes are stealing glances at you<br>
    stop,  shy away when you cast your eyes at me<br>
    cause makes me feel<br>
    like a coward<br>
    and a thief</p>
  <p>but oh, you know, beyond the edge of our exterior<br>
    the itch begins to grow<br>
    we could try to scratch ourselves<br>
    but I just can't help but feel beside myself, when I'm alone</p>
  <p>what's this spell you've cast upon me?<br>
    what do you see when you look at me?<br>
    subconsciously<br>
    you know I know what you need... what you need is me</p>
  <p>well, Lord knows I'm a gentle man<br>
    and I can be sweet<br>
    but underneath I am a beast<br>
    and I want you to come with me<br>
    I'm gonna take you home<br>
    scratch the surface of your soul</p>
  <p>beyond the edge of our exterior<br>
    the itch begins to grow<br>
    we could try to scratch ourselves<br>
    but I just can't help but feel beside myself, when I'm alone</p>
  <p>time to carry it home, yeah, you'll see<br>
    right... it was meant to be<br>
    oh, I'm on fire<br>
    I'm in need<br>
    come to me</p><span style="color:#000000; font-size:10px;">*CutcH is Craig McCutcheon</span></td></tr></table></center>
