<p>this third eye of mine<br>
  has a burning desire to climb<br>
  with a wide eyed stare<br>
  here I am with my feet at the edge</p>
  <p>am I falling<br>
    I feel the ground letting go<br>
    eyes are open, both horrified and bold<br>
    if I scream as I fall of the edge<br>
    will I bound right back like the echoes that fall below?</p>
  <p>the many steps uphill this path has made<br>
    oh, it makes me weary about this leap of faith<br>
    but I found it waiting there<br>
    it's the answer to my prayers<br>
    with the edge of the drop before me<br>
    the questions above, the answers below, <br>
    and a shove</p>
  <p>am I falling? <br>
    I feel the ground letting go<br>
    eyes are open, both horrified and bold<br>
    with a scream as I fall of the edge<br>
    I'll bound right back like the echoes that fall below</p>
  <p>I'm soaring <br>
    exploring<br>
    the answers are mine<br>
    I'm starting to find I'm alive<br>
    and I'm trying to breathe<br>
    this hidden knowledge consumes me<br>
    in every breath I can see<br>
    how beautiful innocence can be</p>
  <p>am I falling? <br>
    I feel the ground letting go<br>
    eyes are open, both horrified and bold<br>
    with a scream as I fall of the edge<br>
    I'll bound right back like the echoes that fall below</p>
  <p>in a moment to help define the soul<br>
