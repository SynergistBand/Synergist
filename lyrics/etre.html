<p>I've been watching the world<br>
    felt the heat of the after burn<br>
    the black bridges behind you<br>
    burn reminders of what you'll learn<br>
    when you drown on your return</p>
  <p>cause in the air<br>
    there's a quiet sense<br>
    I see right through you<br>
    and I'm better than this</p>
  <p>hope you're havin' a ball<br>
    I hope you're clinkin' your glasses while they're  full<br>
    cause in the end what you deserve, it's comin' full circle<br>
    and you'll get what you deserve</p>
  <p>you and I are opposed<br>
    your intentions are yours alone<br>
    you are entangled in all you know<br>
    I think its high time to let it show<br>
    cause in the end it's all you'll know</p>
  <p>and in the air<br>
    there's a quiet sense<br>
    I see right through you<br>
    and I'm better than this</p>
  <p>hope you're havin' a ball<br>
    I hope you're clinkin' your glasses while they're  full<br>
    cause in the end what you deserve, its comin' full circle</p>
  <p>it takes time...  karmatic intervals..<br>
    you can sleep in the bed that you made<br>
    it takes time<br>
    you'll be reaping what you sow<br>
    when you find out the hard way<br>
    I'll be watching from afar<br>
    well you know you'd be honest<br>
    if you were true to who you are</p>
  <p>yea..<br>
    cause in the air<br>
    there's a quiet sense<br>
    I see right through you<br>
    and I'm better than this</p>
  <p>hope you're havin' a ball<br>
    I hope you're clinkin' your glasses while they're  full<br>
    cause in the end what you deserve, its comin' full circle</p>
  <p>and you'll be having the time of your life in the afterworld<br>
    yeah... you think you've figured it out<br>
    but in the end you'll get what you deserve.</p><span style="color:#000000; font-size:10px;">*CutcH is Craig McCutcheon</span></td></tr></table></center>
