<p>(i've been given a taste of the word, so..)</p>
  <p>so now it's time to exhale <br>
    try to show you who I am<br>
    the battle's begun <br>
    and I've sharpened my tongue <br>
    with the message in my weary hands</p>
  <p>lead, or follow?<br>
    the latter is ripe with decay<br>
    and I've been breathing it in but...<br>
    there's only so much I can take<br>
    they underpay my overworking <br>
    it buries me here in my hole in the world</p>
  <p>so now it's time to exhale <br>
    try to show you who I am<br>
    the battle's begun <br>
    and I've sharpened my tongue <br>
    with the message in my weary hands</p>
  <p>i've been watching<br>
    been waiting with eyes on the clock<br>
    i see you drowning<br>
    your words have been thrown in the wash<br>
    you know I can see your every weakness<br>
    you're nothing more than a pawn<br>
    you're a pawn</p>
  <p>so now it's time to exhale <br>
    try to show you who I am<br>
    the battle's begun <br>
    and I've sharpened my tongue <br>
    with the message in my weary hands</p>
  <p>and as I breathe I learn new secrets<br>
    preparing me for the world, and beyond</p>
  <p>and now it's time to exhale <br>
    try to show you who I am<br>
    the battle's begun <br>
    and I've sharpened my tongue <br>
    with the message in my weary hands<br>
