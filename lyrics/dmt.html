<p>welcoming you to the plane of existence<br>
  intoxication ain't hard to find<br>
  open your mind, open your blind eyes</p>
  <p>angels &amp; demons are waiting for you<br>
    your questions left unsaid, but<br>
    these confrontations are more than a few<br>
    and they happen at night <br>
    inside of your head</p>
  <p>now you don't usually question existence<br>
    cause you're unaware as they overtake<br>
    but are you awake?<br>
    is this your true place? I tell you..</p>
  <p>angels &amp; demons are waiting for you<br>
    your questions left unsaid, but<br>
    these confrontations are more than a few<br>
    and they happen at night <br>
    inside of your head</p>
  <p>what if all this were wrong?<br>
    and theirs' was the real world?</p>
  <p>there are those would to misguide you<br>
    they will lead you astray<br>
    but there are the ones who will walk beside you<br>
    don't you push them away..</p>
  <p>angels &amp; demons are waiting for you<br>
    your questions left unsaid, but<br>
    these confrontations are more than a few<br>
    and they happen at night <br>
    inside of your head
