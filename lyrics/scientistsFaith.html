<p>at first the faith was blind<br>
  but then evolved the rational mind</p>
  <p>and all these thing we ask ourselves<br>
    will I face judgment for all the things I've said and done?<br>
    should I resign myself to a power up above?<br>
    does any facet have the answer yet?<br>
    I need to know<br>
    the unknown</p>
  <p>and all these things we ask ourselves<br>
    if I came to find this light would it guide my way along?<br>
    should I define what's right by what others say is wrong?<br>
    does any facet have the answer?<br>
    I need to know<br>
    the unknown</p>
  <p>while all your answers unwittingly<br>
    were lying through your teeth<br>
    this illogical blasphemy<br>
    is blinding what the truth could be<br>
    you're on your knees<br>
    you need eyes open to see<br>
    to let light in<br>
    bless your heart till it's all you need</p>
  <p>till it's all you need</p>
  <p>broken fragments of ancient lore<br>
    echoes of all through the ages <br>
    and on these shoulders stand the giants of our faith</p>
  <p>but the rest, well the rest was out of date<br>
      <br>
    moving onward the way things are<br>
    theories and reasons for everything<br>
    that doesn't mean, my friends, that seeing is belief</p>
  <p>maybe the science is without faith<br>
    maybe the faith is blind<br>
    maybe the science answers how<br>
    and the faith is a why<br>
    while the faith is asking why</p>
  <p style="font-size:11px;">the science is how | <em>spirit</em><br>
    said, the science is asking how | <em>feel it</em> <br>
    and we'll figure it out<br>
    said, the science is asking how | <em>spirit asks why</em><br>
    lets be reasonable about this<br>
    the science is how | <em>feel it asking why</em><br>
    | <em>why?</em></p>
  <p>beating hearts... <br>
    and all these things we ask ourselves<br>
    if I could define this life, would I find my way to love?<br>
    should I align myself with a power up above?<br>
    does any facet have the answer yet?<br>
    I need to know</p>
  <p>the unknown</p><span style="color:#000000; font-size:10px;">*CutcH is Craig McCutcheon</span></td></tr></table></center>
