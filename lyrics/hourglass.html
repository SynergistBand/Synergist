<p>when I began, the world, it gave me little time<br>
  left in the womb, well I would be left to die<br>
  time was slipping through the hourglass<br>
  I can't deny it, I owe my life to disrupting that</p>
  <p>well... time is everything<br>
    it's everything<br>
    but though the moment comes and goes <br>
    believe<br>
    if the time was right for you to meet your ghost, you would</p>
  <p>throughout this life I've been asleep inside of time<br>
    I cannot fight it, I've ingrained it in my mind<br>
    time is slipping through the hourglass<br>
    right here, right now<br>
    I just can't wait for the time to pass</p>
  <p>and well... time is everything<br>
    it's everything<br>
    but though the moment comes and goes <br>
    believe<br>
    if the time was right for you to meet your ghost, you would</p>
  <p>well you'd find your hard earned soul<br>
    as one within it all<br>
    you'll see beyond our &quot;dimensia&quot;<br>
    I believe there is a plane above our minds<br>
    past the constraints of time <br>
    connect to the divine<br>
    see it live, see it die<br>
    ask yourself why</p>
  <p>well I believe there is a plane beyond the bounds of time</p>
  <p>I cant deny myself, cause I don't have the right<br>
    well I search for answers still, I'm of the conscious mind<br>
    time is shattering the hourglass<br>
    I fear the change, but I just can't wait for the aftermath</p>
  <p>yeah, well... time is everything<br>
    it's everything<br>
    but though the moment comes and goes<br>
    believe<br>
    if the time was right for you to meet your ghost, you would</p>
  <p>all this time has come to pass<br>
    and all the while there was the hourglass</p><span style="color:#000000; font-size:10px;">*CutcH is Craig McCutcheon</span></td></tr></table></center>
