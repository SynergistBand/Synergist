<p>well there's a strange<br>
new kind of war<br>
you may think that you're safe<br>
its already in your home<br>
so be afraid<br>
living in this world<br>
never try to escape<br>
it's not safe inside these walls</p>
  <p>you'll feel it again<br>
    controlled by fear, fall into their service and then<br>
    with absence of thought, <br>
    if you break down and let them into your head<br>
    you're already dead</p>
  <p>now there's a plague of hypnotic horror<br>
    our eyes are transfixed<br>
    and we're the hive-mind hoard<br>
    and if you think you could be something more<br>
    you're completely insane<br>
    that's right, you're in the wrong</p>
  <p>you'll feel it again<br>
    controlled by fear, fall into their service and then<br>
    with absence of thought, <br>
    if you break down and let them into your head<br>
    you're already dead</p>
  <p>and this is the waking of the fallen<br>
    get out of our head<br>
    walking undead<br>
    your lying has caused this unrest<br>
    this is the call of the forgotten<br>
    get out of our head<br>
    walking undead<br>
    you're lying, has caused this unrest<br>
    so get out of my head</p>
  <p>well there's a violent fate that will befall us all<br>
    there's already a patsy in place, ready to take that fall<br>
    you'll never see through this blinding fog, <br>
    we report, you decide<br>
    you know the sky's about to fall</p>
  <p>you'll feel it again<br>
    controlled by fear, fall into their service<br>
    with absence of thought, <br>
    if you break down and let them into your head<br>
    you're already dead</p>
  <p>and its the waking of the fallen<br>
    get out of our head<br>
    walking undead<br>
    your lies have caused this unrest<br>
    this is the call of the forgotten<br>
    get out of our head<br>
    you're lying to get into my head<br>
    so get out of my head</p><span style="color:#000000; font-size:10px;">*CutcH is Craig McCutcheon</span></td></tr></table></center>
