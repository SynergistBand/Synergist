  <p>oh, when it's all said and done, well <br>
    you know it's greener in the comfort of the sun until<br>
    when in the comfort of green <br>
    well, you'll finally learn what it actually means to</p>
  <p>inhale perception<br>
    and feel it separate<br>
    and then the instant your misguided fear is erased, replaced<br>
    it's time to make my case</p>
  <p> find a light in the darkest place<br>
    go slow<br>
    discover the afterglow<br>
    you know, to blindly believe<br>
    well it just shows your naivety<br>
    your need to feel the green</p>
  <p>and oh, if I told you the truth, well<br>
    you'd probably think that I'm a liar<br>
    think what you will<br>
    cause I can see through the seams<br>
    in this pocket the world has provided for me<br>
    empowered<br>
    I've been breathing through the looking glass<br>
    so while the rest of you wait for the smoke to pass</p>
  <p>I'll inhale perception<br>
    and feel it separate<br>
    and then the instant your misguided fear is erased, replaced<br>
    it's time to make my case</p>
  <p>light up the darkness<br>
    go slow<br>
    discover the afterglow<br>
    you know, to blindly believe<br>
    well it just shows your naivety<br>
    the need to feel the green</p>
  <p>well, your misconceptions are eating at me<br>
    tales of our fathers' misguided greed<br>
    your misconceptions are tales of misguided reality</p>
  <p>so please, you've got to go slow<br>
    discover the afterglow<br>
    to blindly believe<br>
    you know it shows your naivety<br>
    the need to feel it breathe
    <br>
    the need to feel the green<span style="color:#000000; font-size:10px;"><br>
