  <p>oh, when its all said and done, well <br>
    you know its greener in the comfort of the sun until<br>
    when in the comfort of green <br>
    well, you'll finally learn what it actually means to</p>
  <p>inhale perception<br>
    and feel it separate<br>
    and in the instant your misguided fear is erased, replaced<br>
    its time to make my case</p>
  <p> find a light in the darkest place<br>
    go slow<br>
    discover the afterglow<br>
    you know, to blindly believe<br>
    well it just shows your naivety<br>
    the need to feel the green</p>
  <p>oh, if I told you the truth, well<br>
    you'd probably think that I'm a liar<br>
    think what you will<br>
    cause I can see through the seams<br>
    inside this pocket the world has provided for me<br>
    empowered<br>
    I've been breathing through the looking glass<br>
    so while the rest of you wait for the smoke to pass, i'll</p>
  <p>inhale perception<br>
    and feel it separate<br>
    and in the instant your misguided fear is erased, replaced<br>
    its time to make my case</p>
  <p>light up the darkness<br>
    go slow<br>
    discover the afterglow<br>
    you know, to blindly believe<br>
    well it just shows your naivety<br>
    the need to feel the green</p>
  <p>your misconceptions are eating at me<br>
    tales of our fathers' misguided greed<br>
    your misconceptions are tales of misguided society</p>
  <p>so please, you've got to go slow<br>
    discover the afterglow<br>
    when you blindly believe<br>
    you know shows your naivety<br>
    the need to feel the green<span style="color:#000000; font-size:10px;">*CutcH is Craig McCutcheon</span></p></td></tr></table></center>
