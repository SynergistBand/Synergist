<p><em>step back</em><br>
  <br>
  here stands the nemesis of what I beleive to be<br>
  I fight the good fight in every day<br>
  you walk around like you're not due for a reckoning<br>
  I'm here to help you to rue the day </p>
<p>'cause you're not seeing it our way</p>
<p><em>stand down</em><br>
  <br>
  well I've tried to pride myself on holding integrity<br>
  but God I hate watching you succeed<br>
  pullin' knives from backs with horror in disbeleif<br>
  as you pay no mind to the ones betrayed<br>
  that's why I say</p>
<p>that you're not seeing it our way<br>
  having honour is key<br>
  but I can't stop thinkin' I'm not where I deserve to be<br>
  unlocks the cell and brings out the villain in me</p>
<p>feeling the wrong way<br>
  step back, stand down, you've had your day<br>
  turn the tables, turn another page<br>
my white into gray</p>
<p>turning over tables in the temple's not the way I was raised<br>
  but even righteous men have moments of rage</p>
<p>you're not seeing it our way<br>
  having honour is key<br>
  but I can't stop thinkin' I'm not where I deserve to be<br>
  turns out the villain in you churns out the villain in me<br>
  muhuhahahahahahahahahahaha!
