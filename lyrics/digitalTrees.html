<p>all alone again<br>
  the air I breathe has such a barren scent to it<br>
  in my head, something less, someone more, nothing less than a dream</p>
  <p>and I hope...<br>
    these broken branches make a stand for me<br>
    this one and three</p>
  <p>fallen leaves cover all the roots surrounding me<br>
    but it's here you will find blinding sunshine behind broken shade</p>
  <p>and I hope...<br>
    these barren branches make a stand for me<br>
    this one and three<br>
    while my future is unknown<br>
    I guess I'll dwell in false reality<br>
    these... digital trees</p>
  <p>all my prayers for inheritance<br>
    they met uncertain subtle arrogance<br>
    but all I'll see, and all I'll be, is a mystery</p>
  <p>my atrophy is eating at the best of me<br>
    but in agony, here I am, reaching out, budding green<br>
    and I hope...</p>
  <p>these budding branches make a stand for me<br>
    this one and three<br>
    while my future is unknown<br>
    I guess I'll dwell in false reality<br>
    these... digital trees</p>
  <p>all my prayers for inheritance<br>
    they met uncertain subtle arrogance<br>
    is all I'll see, and all I'll be, just another one of your digital trees?<br>
