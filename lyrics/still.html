<p>so if the plan is moving forward<br>
  let's cut the brakes as we roll along<br>
  you know it's tricky pulling over<br>
  watch me crash into the wall</p>
  <p>just leave me dying on the bloody floor<br>
    they always do<br>
    things have changed<br>
    it's so much brighter than it was before<br>
    and all these things were killing me<br>
    till I decided I should let it be</p>
  <p>and as the time was moving onward<br>
    well I'd come to count on you one and all<br>
    and with the rest all safely wired<br>
    still you make me me take the fall</p>
  <p>just leave me dying on the bloody floor<br>
    they always do<br>
    things have changed<br>
    it's so much brighter than it was before<br>
    and all these things were killing me<br>
    till I decided I should let it be</p>
  <p>I need you to see<br>
    I'm on it <br>
    I breathe<br>
    I'm on it<br>
    perceive<br>
    I'm on it<br>
    I bleed<br>
    I'm on it, believe.</p>
  <p>in the same way we've all been dying to rest here in peace<br>
    (still alive when I breathe)<br>
    in the same way they're all allying to keep you in need <br>
    (it's what I choose to perceive)<br>
    it's the same thing that keeps you off your knees</p>
  <p>I know I've seen this all before<br>
    I bleed<br>
    I know I've been here once before<br>
    and I bleed just to see inside of me<br>
    I know I must be doing something wrong<br>
    but I've been dying to make you see</p>
  <p>see me dying on the floor<br>
    the angels passing over bloody doors<br>
    well they always do<br>
    the same thing<br>
    but so much brighter than it was before<br>
    and all these things were killing me<br>
    till I decided I should let it be<br>
    I let it be
