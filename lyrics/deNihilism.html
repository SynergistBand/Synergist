<p>under the lullaby moves a silence feared by most<br>
  we shut our eyes, just to rest for a while<br>
  but the nightmare, well, it's woken us up</p>
  <p>in the end <br>
    given more than you've taken away<br>
    tried hard<br>
    we learn thinkin' of your mistakes<br>
    save for the darkness there's no other way for the dawn to break</p>
  <p>our demise set the planet alight but the cycle promotes a growth<br>
    we stumbled blind for a short little while <br>
    but the fire rallied our eyes to adjust</p>
  <p>in the end <br>
    given more than you've taken away<br>
    tried hard<br>
    we learn thinkin' of your mistakes<br>
    save for the darkness there's no other way for the dawn to break</p>
  <p>you know that time will make this right, it's time to go<br>
  it starts with the cycle<br>
    with a circle</p>
  <p>now you could deny my right to criticize<br>
    cause your dominion, well it don't see to my life<br>
    but don't you dare close my eyes<br>
    we've been watching like a bird in flight</p>
  <p>goodnight, goodbye<br>
    we'll crowd around to see you die<br>
    and all of this time<br>
    with your pride<br>
    you've been part of churning out the wise<br>
    you've been fired<br>
    you've been catalyzed</p>
  <p>if your failure had all been for not<br>
    would we still be your fools or what?<br>
    what's this feeling we cannot ignore?<br>
    you've revived the informed</p>
  <p>in the end <br>
    given more than you've taken away<br>
    tried hard<br>
    we learn thinkin' of your mistakes<br>
    save for the darkness there's no other way for the dawn to break</p>
  <p>you know that time will make this right, it's time to go<br>
  it ends with the cycle<br> 
    with a circle</p>
