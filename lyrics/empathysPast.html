<p>when you look into the mirror<br>
  who's staring gaze do your blind eyes meet?<br>
  tell me, is it who you are?<br>
  or is it what you were made to believe?</p>
  <p>tragedies came knockin'<br>
    but you did away with them,<br>
    cause your pocketbooks were thin<br>
    catastrophes came knockin'<br>
    but you did away them,<br>
    disguised it as a win and</p>
  <p>the big red button made the call on life or death<br>
    smile and keep on pressing while the wealthier get rich</p>
  <p>I bet you're real empathetic<br>
    when your finger is on the red<br>
    is it blood over money<br>
    when your trigger is on their heads?</p>
  <p>yeah, my finger's right in your face<br>
    I see your skin's new fault lines<br>
    your falling from grace</p>
  <p>when catastrophes come again<br>
    you'll do away with them<br>
    disguise it as a win</p>
  <p>feed off the ignorance of those you claim you're with<br>
    smile and take their money as the wealthier get rich</p>
  <p>and oh, dontcha feel empathetic<br>
    when your fingers are stained in red<br>
    is it blood over money<br>
    when your trigger is on their heads?</p>
  <p>smooth it out with arrogance<br>
    and predetermined  wit<br>
    I hope you choke on it<br>
    hope you choke on your bullshit</p>
  <p>is it blood, or for money<br>
    when your fingers are stained red?<br>
    do you feel empathetic<br>
    when your trigger is on their heads?<br>
