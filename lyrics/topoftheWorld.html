<p>at the top, in the know<br>
  you've had it out for us from the get go<br>
  in the dark, we are, while.. <br>
  misinformation delays enlightening the soul </p>
  <p>I dono...</p>
  <p>hey... I gotta say<br>
    if i were leading somewhere<br>
    I'd hold my morals in their place<br>
    and teach the masses</p>
  <p>lies, speak to me<br>
    please tell me what my opinion should be<br>
    till we all nod and smile<br>
    the carbon copy, the standard of our beliefs</p>
  <p>who to be...</p>
  <p>hey... I gotta say<br>
    if I were leading somewhere<br>
    I'd hold my morals in their place</p>
  <p>but there are so many lies<br>
    met with glazed and accepting eyes<br>
    from flames to ashes</p>
  <p>hey... I gotta say<br>
    I see you leading somewhere<br>
    but not a moral in your wake</p>
  <p>you're too preoccupied<br>
    making profit from wasted lives to see<br>
    if you would teach the masses, we could be free<br>
