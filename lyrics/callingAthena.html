  <span style="font-size:10px;"><i>by Fallen Prospect -  Lyrics by CutcH*</i></span><br>
  </center>
<p>when she was taken away from me<br>
  I misplaced the world<br>
  and I, I could never define a heart so pure<br>
  but I, I remember she said it all without saying a word</p>
  <p>but to my dismay<br>
    her presence was taken away from us<br>
    in that moment<br>
    words cant explain<br>
    the feeling of loss when you passed on<br>
    you embodied everything that's good</p>
  <p>i'll be missing her warm embrace <br>
    till I'm dead and gone<br>
    when I, I'll be calling Athen' to guide me home<br>
    and I, I would trust her to guide the way into the unknown</p>
  <p>to my dismay<br>
    her presence was taken away from us<br>
    in that moment<br>
    words cant explain<br>
    the feeling of loss when you passed on<br>
    you embody everything that's good</p>
  <p>its not right<br>
    in her absence<br>
    I search the skies for one more day<br>
    was it time? who's to blame<br>
    for the injustice of her passing away?</p>
  <p>words can't explain, the feeling of loss when...<br>
    to my dismay<br>
    her presence was taken away from us<br>
    in that moment<br>
    words cant explain<br>
    the feeling of loss when you passed on<br>
    you embodied everything that's good</p>
  <p>I know your spirit will live on in me<br>
  </p>
