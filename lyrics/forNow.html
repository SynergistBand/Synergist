<p>is this our war?<br>
  is this what we're fighting for?<br>
  is this our war<br>
  is this worth fighting for<br>
  <br>
  worry<br>
  running through my head<br>
  before it even happened<br>
  I knew just what you did</p>
  <p>and you lied to me</p>
  <p>behind those eyes <br>
    I thought there were no lies<br>
    if you were so  innocent you'd have nothing to hide</p>
  <p>worry<br>
    running through my head<br>
    forced to say I&rsquo;m sorry<br>
    for things I never said</p>
  <p>behind my eyes<br>
    there are no lies<br>
    it's deceit, mistrust and mostly your mistake that I despise</p>
  <p>now... it's over<br>
    I cant help it<br>
    can't you see?<br>
    you, you made me... made me feel.. feel like second best, again<br>
    I cant help it<br>
    how should I be?<br>
    I thought she knew how much she meant to me</p>
  <p>worry<br>
    running through my head<br>
    waiting for I'm sorry<br>
    the thing that she never said</p>
  <p>all that you say you missed <br>
    the winks and hints<br>
    I give you credit,  you knew better than this</p>
  <p>for now, for now<br>
    I wipe this from my brow<br>
    for now, emotion bruises<br>
    your middle name ain't boom, sis.<br>
    I don't know who you are</p>
  <p>I cant help it<br>
    how should I be?<br>
    I thought she knew how much she meant to me<br>
    I said I cant help it<br>
    why cant you see? I thought you knew how much you meant to me<br>
