  </center>
<p>set the fire<br>
  light the flame<br>
  burn it all to the floor<br>
  amalgamation of a future self with what I've become before<br>
  it's about time you all just gave me what I need<br>
  spent too much time behind the scenes</p>
  <p>never feels like my rock<br>
    catches up with the roll<br>
    and with blurry eyes I can't see where I'm goin'</p>
  <p>where have I been?<br>
    with all the time that I've been livin'<br>
    where have I been?</p>
  <p>this is no second round<br>
    I've been through this before<br>
    all the time I thought was playing hard, it was training, starting over<br>
    I've been so high, you know, it feels like I should soar<br>
    spreading my wings is fine but flying's so much more</p>
  <p>never feels like my rock<br>
    catches up with the roll<br>
    and with blurry eyes I can't see where I'm goin'</p>
  <p>where have I been?<br>
    in all the time that I've been given<br>
    where have I been?</p>
  <p>now, it never feels like my rock<br>
    catches up with the roll<br>
    and with dirty eyes I can't see where I'm goin'</p>
  <p>where have I been?<br>
    in all the lives and new beginnings<br>
    where have I been?<br>
