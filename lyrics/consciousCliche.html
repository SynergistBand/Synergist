<p>high tide's come in again<br>
  we're up to our necks in it<br>
  I hope you're ready to dive right in<br>
  we'll make the best of it<br>
  that's who we are</p>
  <p>the time is right for the world<br>
    now vindicated, to take back control<br>
    the stars have aligned, and they're pullin' their lines with the undertow<br>
    with high tide rising beside you<br>
    you're sinking like a stone<br>
    your pretensions weigh you down<br>
    tied to the floor</p>
  <p>cause high tide's come in again<br>
    and we're up to our necks in it<br>
    I hope you're ready to dive right in<br>
    we'll make the best of it</p>
  <p>that's who we are<br>
    (when the tide's coming in)<br>
    that's who we ought to be<br>
    (this is not a philosophy)<br>
    that's who we are<br>
    it's all we know how to be</p>
  <p>now you may decide you can float<br>
    carried to sea with the brightest of hopes<br>
    drifting along away from the shore<br>
    on a child's balloon<br>
    &amp; pop</p>
  <p>to our necks in it all...<br>
    to our necks in all the promises<br>
    cowards and props<br>
    the innocent and the lost<br>
    when high tide's rising beside you<br>
    you've got to swim to reach your goals<br>
    I tread the line between the depths and the skies<br>
    I know it's clich&eacute; but..</p>
  <p>the tide's come in again<br>
    and we're up to our necks in it<br>
    I hope you're ready to dive right in<br>
    we'll make the best...</p>
  <p>that's who we are<br>
    (when the tide's coming in)<br>
    that's who we ought to be<br>
    (this is not a philosophy)<br>
    that's who we are<br>
    it's all we know how to be</p><span style="color:#000000; font-size:10px;">*CutcH is Craig McCutcheon</span></td></tr></table></center>
