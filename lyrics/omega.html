<p>I am the segue to a greater man unfurled<br>
  I've stood beside myself with all the lonely world <br>
  I am the worthy, or so I've heard<br>
  still I sabotage the world at every turn</p>
  <p>will reality ever find a way?<br>
    after the rains came, tell me why weren't you washing away?</p>
  <p>beneath the discord of the chances I have missed<br>
    I hear the calling of the damsel in distress<br>
    if I found her, would I know?<br>
    would I be grateful for the path that I'd chose?</p>
  <p>will reality ever find a way?<br>
    after the rains came, all this time you wouldn't wash away<br>
    come to me<br>
    will this part of me ever be the sane?<br>
    don't you lie to me, lie to me<br>
    why are you running away?</p>
  <p>I believe in all these things<br>
    duality<br>
    and duplicity<br>
    will the alpha ever find a way <br>
    to omega's hiding place?</p>
  <p>and the hours they will turn<br>
    I am haunted by the girl<br>
    till it conquers my world<br>
    my demise is inevitable</p>
  <p>the segue to the heartache<br>
    is more than chest pains I'm sure<br>
    still I'm tearing away<br>
    am I finding a way<br>
    to make sense of different worlds?</p>
  <p>will reality ever find a way?<br>
    after the rains came, all this time you wouldn't wash away<br>
    come to me<br>
    will this part of me ever be the sane?<br>
    lie to me, lie to me<br>
    I'd rather be blind than insane</p><span style="color:#000000; font-size:10px;">*CutcH is Craig McCutcheon</span></td></tr></table></center>
