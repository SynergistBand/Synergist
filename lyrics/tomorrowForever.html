<p>hello?<br>
  is this the fork in the road?<br>
  are you the answer I've been searching for?<br>
  are you just a spark?<br>
  now I've been trying way too hard define what I saw<br>
  the question is<br>
  are you a sign from God?</p>
  <p>it only breached the darkness for a moment<br>
    but with this now I find the will to carry on, again</p>
  <p>and all I can feel the sense that it left me with<br>
    i'm not alone<br>
    and I am still enchanted by this fallen blinding sun<br>
    and I ask myself<br>
    am I the only one?</p>
  <p>it only breached the darkness for a moment<br>
    but with this now I find the will to carry on, again</p>
  <p>it came and went<br>
    i see you bridging the gap 'tween the universe and the world<br>
    and I gained so much more than you lost when I watched you crash and burn<br>
    in your death I have found tomorrow<br>
    you know it.. </p>
  <p>only breached the darkness for a moment<br>
    but with this now I find the will to carry on<br>
    it breached the darkness for a moment<br>
    but in this light I've found forever and beyond<br>
  </p>
