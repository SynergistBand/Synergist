    <section>
     <p>Synergist is a hard rock band from Toronto, Canada. Their blend of rock, metal and punk influences allows the band to put a focus on songwriting, while fulfiling a desire to challenge themselves musically at the same time. Steadily building a repertoire of songs and a strong band dynamic since 2006, Synergist utilize each member's skills and tastes for a melodic heavy sound.</p>
