      Synergist is a hard rock band from Toronto, Canada. Formed by longtime friends CutcH, Jon Lewis and Christopher Lyttle, 
      the&nbsp;band blends alternative, metal, prog and punk influences to create a unique style. Striving to find 
      a balance between songwriting and pushing themselves musically, Synergist utilizes each member's skills and tastes for a 
      melodic heavy&nbsp;sound. 
      <br />&nbsp;<br />
      2013 saw the release of the Synergist's self-titled debut album, which was written, recorded and produced independently by the band. 
      It&nbsp;is available for download at <a href="http://synergist.bandcamp.com">synergist.bandcamp.com</a>.
