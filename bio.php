      Synergist is a hard rock band from Toronto, Ontario, Canada formed by Jon Lewis, Chris Lyttle & Craig McCutcheon. 
      The longtime friends blend alternative, metal, prog and punk influences to try and create something unique with a harder edge,  
      while growing and pushing themselves as musicians at the same time. Steadily building a repertoire of songs to build 
      a strong band dynamic, Synergist utilize each member's skills and tastes for a 
      melodic heavy sound.
