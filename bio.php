    <h1>Bio</h1>
    <section>
      Synergist is a hard rock band from Toronto, Canada. Their blend of&nbsp;alternative, metal and 
      punk influences allows the band to put a focus on songwriting, while fulfiling a desire to 
      challenge themselves musically at the same time. Steadily building a repertoire of songs and 
      a strong band dynamic since 2006, Synergist utilize each member's skills and tastes for a 
      melodic heavy sound. 
      <br />&nbsp;<br />
      The band has adopted the DIY ethic of many independant artists in this era, writing and 
      recording material themselves. Fans can download  Synergist's self-titled debut album from 
      <a href="http://synergist.bandcamp.com">synergist.bandcamp.com</a>.
